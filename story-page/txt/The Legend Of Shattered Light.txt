🌒 THE LEGEND OF SHATTERED LIGHT

In a time not yet spoken,
When darkness once again threatened to rise...
Three heroes were chosen.
Three souls stood at the edge of all worlds.

Their fate? Long hidden.
Their ending... unknown.

This is the legend of Shattered Light.




---

The Human Knight… the Cage.

A vessel of silence.
Bound by will, bound by chains.
They stood in defiance—
Sword drawn.
Shield raised.
But could not move.
Could not act.

The blade—broken.
The shield—splintered.
Their SOUL…
That fragile ember,
Flickered once…

Then burst—
Into a thousand glimmers of lost purpose.

And the Knight lay still.

Never to rise again.




---

The Prince of the Dark… the Speaker of Prophecy.

Born of kindness, made of light.
He reached through chaos,
Not with wrath, but with healing.

But the foe was cruel.
The world, unyielding.

His arms outstretched,
His voice calm…

And still, he fell.

Impaled by hate,
Dusted by fate,
Valiant until the very end.




---

And Last The Girl, At Last Was The Girl.

The storm.
The rage.
The heart that dared to care.

Broken.
Bleeding.
Her axe—taken.
Turned against her.

Brave?
Or just a fool who refused to fall?



 She roared.
She cursed.
She stood tall even as she sank.

Her voice cracked—
Not from anger,
But from grief.

As the Prince dissolved.

As the Knight shattered.

Her heart…
Fractured like theirs.

Her best friend.
Her only friend.

Stolen.




---

And still...

She stands.

No weapon.
No ally.
No hope.

Just two fists,
Clenched tight against the darkness.

Driven not by destiny—
But by loss.

By fury.
By love.

By the refusal to let the light go out.




---

So ends the tale untold.

A Knight who fell.
A Prince who faded.
A Girl who rose.

And in the end...
When all light has shattered—
Only the broken may choose to burn.
