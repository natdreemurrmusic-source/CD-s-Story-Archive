You cry out in pain as Toriel accidentally lands the final blow.

Your SOUL trembles…
Cracks form — spiderweb thin — but final.

You fall to your knees, vision

You look up at her with a betrayed look in your eyes.

You thought she wanted to protect you.

You trusted her.

Toriel gasps.
Her hands drop to her sides, shaking.
“MY CHILD!”

"No—" she whispers.

The last thing you see through your tears before your SOUL shatters…

...is her horrified face.

Your SOUL fractures.

White.

Then nothing.

Silence.

---

Toriel drops to her knees.

The fire in the room dies out.

Her arms wrap around her chest, as if to hold in the pieces of herself now spilling out.

She reaches forward, trembling, as if — somehow — she can still catch you.

But you’re not dust.
You're not supposed to be dust.

Humans don’t turn to dust.

Only monsters do.

So what lies there now is...
Just a body.

Still.
Unmoving.

Cold.

The ruins are quiet, but her breath is loud — ragged, uneven, broken.

And then it hits her.

Just like before.
Just like them.

Chara.

The name screams in her mind like a fire alarm no one can shut off.

The child she once raised.
The child she once lost.

And now… another.

She presses her forehead to the floor, lips quivering, whispering apologies to someone who can’t hear them anymore.

“I didn’t mean to... I didn’t... I just wanted to keep you safe…”

Her tears hit the stone floor.

Drip.
Drip.
Drip.

She doesn't know how long she stays there.

---

Far away, but not too far…

In the shadows behind the cracks in the ruin walls…

A flower watches.

Wide-eyed.
Unblinking.

His smirk grows as her sobs echo down the empty halls.

He saw everything.

He didn’t need to stop it.

In
It was better this way.

“Ohhh, Tori…” he mutters, half-laughing, half-mocking. “You really thought love could fix everything, didn’t you?”

A giggle escapes him, jagged and mean.

He could rewind this.
He could.

He has enough Determination.

But where’s the fun in that?

He vanishes into the earth, leaving only his echo behind.

"See you at the funeral.”

---

It’s quiet in the Ruins.

Too quiet.

Even the frogs have stopped croaking.

Toriel stands before the great door — the exit that leads to the rest of the Underground.
To Snowdin.
To him.

She hasn’t approached this door in a long time.
Not since she made him promise.

Her knuckles tremble just before she knocks.

knock

There’s a long pause.

Then a voice on the other side, casual as ever.

"heya. thought you’d forgotten this old door."

She tries to answer.

Nothing comes out.

“…tori?”

The voice shifts. The levity fades.

“you okay?”

She sucks in a breath.

And then breaks.

---

“I—I… I killed them.”

She slides down the stone wall, back pressed to it, hand over her mouth.

“I… I didn’t mean to. I thought… they were going to leave. I was trying to stop them, just scare them, just a little more, one more spell—”

She covers her face.

“But they didn’t dodge.”

Silence from the other side.

Toriel stares at the floor.

“I—I saw their eyes. At the very end. I saw…”

She wipes at her face.

“You told me to let go. You told me to have hope again. And I tried. I tried to love them like my own.”

Her voice cracks.

“But now they’re gone. And I broke the very promise I made you make.”

---

There’s a pause.

Then, quietly:

“they didn’t make it out of the ruins.”

She flinches.

“…no.”

More silence.

“…you didn’t take the soul to asgore.”

She shudders.

“No. I… I couldn’t.”

“They’re just… gone.”

She nods, even though he can’t see her.

“I watched it shatter. Right in front of me. And I didn’t even try to absorb it. I was too… horrified.”

Her voice goes quiet.

“And now… another child will come.”

She closes her eyes.

“Another life will have to be lost, eventually. Because of me.”

The quiet hangs.

Dead air.

Then the voice behind the door speaks again.

Softer.

Not judgmental.

Just… tired.

“guess that’s how it goes down here, huh.”

Toriel doesn't respond.

“we make promises. then life finds a way to tear 'em up.”

Her hand tightens around her sleeve.

“I just wanted to protect them…”

The silence feels colder now.

She curls in on herself, knees to her chest, resting her forehead there.

---

On the other side, Sans leans against the door.

He stares at the stone beneath him.

Eyes dark.

One of them flickers faintly.

“…kiddo.”

He says it to no one.

Maybe to you.

Maybe to the dust floating in the air.

---

Somewhere far away…

A flower chuckles in the dark.

“Whoopsie.”

He giggles, cruel and breathless.

“Well, guess we’re back to square one again. Too bad, huh?”

He leans toward the ground.

“Still, this timeline’s shaping up to be hilarious.”

He hums.

“Wonder how many promises I can break next?”

He slips back into the soil.

And the Underground waits.

Again.

---

It’s been some time.

Days?
Weeks?

Toriel doesn’t count anymore.

The fire in the hearth is always low.

She barely eats.
Barely moves.

The ruins are as quiet as they were before you fell.

Maybe even quieter.

She sits in her chair by the fire, book resting in her lap, untouched.

Her eyes are distant.

And then—

knock knock

She flinches.

Another human?

No.

The knock is too slow.

Too gentle.

She rises carefully and opens the door.

There, floating just above the mossy stone, is a familiar figure.

“o-oh… h-hi miss toriel…”

Napstablook adjusts his headphones awkwardly, not meeting her eyes.

“I… I came back… from the farm… the snail farm… y-you know, it’s slow work… heh… heh…”

He clears his non-existent throat.

“I… I was wondering…”

He drifts a bit lower.

“…i didn’t see your new guest in Waterfall… and I thought maybe… maybe they just decided to stay here with you.”

He shifts nervously, flickering slightly.

“i-i brought some of my new tracks… i thought maybe… maybe they’d like to hear them…”

He offers a small cassette.
It floats between them.

Toriel stares.

Doesn’t reach for it.

Her heart caves in on itself.

Napstablook's expression is always neutral… but now it seems… even sadder.
Heavy.

Still, he keeps talking.

“They… they were really nice to me.”

He sniffs. Or tries to.

“They… they listened. N-no one ever listens…”

His voice gets quieter.

“And… and they smiled.”

Toriel covers her mouth, trembling.

“I didn’t know what it felt like to be someone's first friend until…”

He pauses.

His words hang.

Like his soul does — barely tethered.

Toriel falls to her knees.

The cassette drops.

“I—I didn’t know…”

She sobs, her voice brittle.

“I didn’t know they… made friends. I thought I was protecting them. I thought I was guiding them.”

She clutches the front of her robe.

“But I was only… I was only trying to keep them for myself.”

She remembers the Froggit.

The way you spoke so kindly.
Complimented it.
Even though it could’ve hurt you.

She made it run away.

Because she thought it was dangerous.

She thought it couldn’t be trusted.

She thought…

But she was wrong.

You were making friends the moment you arrived.

You always had.

And she—

She took that from everyone.

Napstablook floats there silently.

He doesn’t leave.

He just… hovers.

Quietly.

As Toriel weeps into the mossy stone floor.

---

Elsewhere, through cracked vines and stone…

A small frog peers from the dark.

Its eyes shimmer.

It lets out one soft croak.

Then hops away.

Searching.

Waiting.

Missing you.

---

Somewhere deep below, in a garden of golden flowers…

A flower shakes with laughter.

“Oh man. This just keeps getting better.”

He smiles.

It’s not a kind smile.

“Everyone’s just falling apart without you, huh?”

He chuckles.

But…
For just a second…

He looks toward the surface.
Toward the memory of you.

His smile twitches.

And for the briefest moment…

He almost frowns.

---

Somewhere far beneath the Ruins…
Past the stone.
Past the echoes.
Past the memories…

A lone golden flower sways in silence.

Flowey stares upward.

Watching.

Listening.

He’s been following it all.

Toriel’s cries.
Napstablook’s hurt.
The quiet places you used to walk, now echoing without your steps.

It’s funny.

It should be funny.

He laughs.

“Hah… haha… HAHA—!”

But the sound is hollow.

Like a bad punchline no one laughed at.

His face twitches.

He looks back toward the cracked stone paths of the Ruins.

He remembers when you walked there.

When you called him friend.

Even after he tried to kill you.

Even after he laughed in your face.

You smiled at him.

Just like they used to.

Chara.

He doesn’t have a SOUL.

He knows that.

Reminds himself of it daily.

But...

Then why does his stem feel like it’s curling in?

Why does the silence feel so much heavier than it used to?

Why does he keep watching?

---

Flowey frowns.

Just for a moment.

Then he shakes his head hard enough to rattle his petals.

“N-no. Nope. Not doing this. I’m not…”

He snarls.

“I’m NOT sad. I don’t feel bad.”

He slams a vine into the ground.

Dust scatters.

“But even if I was… who cares?”

A sharp grin crawls across his face again.

“I can just RESET when I’m done watching this circus. I can bring the kid back. Just to watch it all fall apart again. Over and over.”

He laughs again.

Still hollow.

But louder this time.

“Y’know… maybe next time I’ll let her live long enough to meet Sans. Watch his face when she never makes it to him. Now that would be priceless.”

He smirks.

But his leaf twitches.

A petal wilts just slightly.

His gaze lingers again on the place where your SOUL shattered.

He saw it.
He remembers.

The look in your eyes.

The forgiveness.

The trust.

Even at the end.

Even after everything.

You reminded him so much of…

He snarls again and slams the ground.

“STOP THINKING ABOUT THAT.”

“I DON’T CARE. I DON’T CARE!!”

But the echoes don’t answer.

There’s no one left in the Ruins to laugh with him.

No one to fear him.

No one…

Not even you.

---

Back in the house…

Toriel lies curled beside the cold fireplace, clutching the corner of your bandage.

The one you left in the drawer.

The one you never came back for.

Outside her door, the moss grows slowly.

Waiting.

Alone.

---

And somewhere, beneath the roots of the earth…

A golden flower sways in silence.

Trying to forget a face it should never have remembered.
