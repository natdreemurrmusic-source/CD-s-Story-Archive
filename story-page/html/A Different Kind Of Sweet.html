Title: A Different Kind of Sweet

MC sighed, adjusting his bag as he followed Sayori down the hall. She had been going on and on about some literature club she wanted him to join, but honestly, he wasn’t sure if it was his thing. Still, it was hard to say no to Sayori when she got into this cheerful, persistent, and just a little bit whiny attitude. …Oh and hungry. Always hungry.

As they turned a corner, MC suddenly collided with someone, stumbling back slightly.

“Hey, watch where you’re—” The girl stopped mid-sentence, blinking up at him with sharp, pink eyes. She had pink hair to match, cut short and styled in neat little twin tails. She wasn’t scowling exactly, but her arms were crossed, and she looked as though she were sizing him up.

“Oh! Natsuki!” Sayori chimed in, stepping beside MC. “Are you okay?”

Natsuki brushed herself off, her expression shifting to something more neutral. “Yeah, whatever. He’s the one who bumped into me.”

MC took a moment to take her in. She wasn’t particularly short, actually, she was pretty average height. But there was something about her presence, the way she held herself, that made her seem... confident. A stark contrast to the nervous energy he sometimes saw in Sayori.

“Uh, sorry about that,” MC offered, rubbing

Natsuki shrugged. “Just pay attention next time.”

Sayori giggled. “Oh yeah! Natsuki, this is my childhood friend! I’m trying to get him to join the literature club!”

Natsuki raised an eyebrow. “Literature club? Huh. Never thought you’d be into that.”

MC scratched his cheek, unsure how to respond. “I’m, uh, still deciding.”

She gave him a little smirk. “Well, don’t let Sayori guilt you into it. But I guess books aren’t that bad.”

MC tilted his head. “You like reading?”

For a split second, she hesitated, but then she nodded. “Yeah. Got into manga when I was a kid. Still read it now.”

Something about the way she said it made MC curious. It wasn’t hesitant or defensive, there was no need to be. It was just a fact, something she liked, and she wasn’t afraid to admit it.

That was… different.

“Huh,” he said. “What kind of manga?”

She blinked, as if surprised he was asking. Say
“Mostly shoujo,” Natsuki admitted. “But I like a lot of different genres. Some action, some slice-of-life, whatever’s good.”

MC nodded, actually interested. “Got any recommendations?”

Natsuki stared at him for a moment before smirking again. “Maybe. But only if you promise to actually read them.”

He grinned. “Deal.”

Sayori practically squealed. “Ooooh! This is so fun! Natsuki, you should totally join the club too!”

Natsuki rolled her eyes. “Nah. I’ve got my own stuff. Besides, I already have enough friends.”

MC noticed the way she said it… not defensive, not sad, just matter-of-fact. She wasn’t lonely. She wasn’t looking for a place to belong. She already had that.

But still… something about her made him want to get to know her more.

“Hey, if you ever feel like talking manga, let me know,” he said casually.

Natsuki gave him a quick glance, then smirked again. “Yeah, yeah. We’ll see.”

And with that, she turned and walked off, leaving MC standing there, oddly intrigued.

Sayori nudged him. “Sooo? What do you think?”

He watched Natsuki disappear into the crowd.

“I think she’s interesting.”
