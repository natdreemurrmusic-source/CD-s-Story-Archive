THREADS IN THE DARK
Chapter 1: Just the library
It started with a knock.
Not the kind of knock people give when they’re being polite. Kris had a way of tapping, light, distant, like the sound didn’t belong to them. Like they were just passing it along.
Chara opened the door to her room and raised an eyebrow.
 Kris stood there, bag slung over their shoulder, scarf half-tied like they didn’t care if it dragged on the sidewalk. They didn’t say anything
Kris held up two fingers, one for her, one for them…then mimed walking.
“...We’re goin’ somewhere?” she guessed.
Kris nodded once, then made a vague gesture that looked like scribbling. Writing. School?
“library?”
Another nod.
She blinked. “Wait… the one by the school?”
Kris tilted their head, then shrugged. That usually meant “close enough.”
“Why? You never go there.”
They finally spoke…quiet, monotone. “Noelle asked me to study.”
Noelle.
 Chara grinned, one eyebrow cocked.
“Ellie, huh?” she said, leaning against the doorway. “Didn’t know you two were still doin’ the whole awkward bestie thing.”
Kris didn’t respond.
Chara watched their back for a moment, then grabbed her jacket and followed, calling after them with a sing-song voice.
“Well, guess what? I’m comin’ too! You know I gotta keep Ellie from drownin’ in your silence.”
Kris paused, then gave a small nod, eyes shadowed by their bangs.

The wind bit hard that morning, slicing across Hometown like someone had left the freezer open. Chara walked with her hands in her hoodie pocket, heart-shaped locket tucked warm against her chest. The photo inside was of her, Kris, and Asriel. It bounced gently with each step that she took.
She was shorter than Kris, always had been. The wind made her hoodie flap like a cape behind her, and she took every opportunity to hop onto snow-patched cracks and kick at icicles under gutters.
Kris didn’t speak much. They never did. But this silence wasn’t the usual peaceful quiet they carried. It was hollow. Heavy. Like they were listening to something far away. Or inside themselves.
Chara didn’t notice, not really. She was too busy joking, poking fun, and skipping around.
Because she trusted them.
 She always trusted them.

Noelle was already outside the library, standing with her hands jammed into her coat sleeves, foggy breath puffing in the air. Her eyes lit up when she saw them.
“O-oh! Hey, Kris! And…hi, Chara! I didn’t know you were coming…”
“Ellie~!” Chara called, throwing her arms up like she was being reunited with a long-lost friend… Even though they had just seen each other last week.  “Please tell me you brought snacks.”
Noelle laughed shyly. “Sorry, I-I didn’t. I thought we were gonna study…”
“Boooo.” Chara stuck out her tongue. “I came here for mischief. And maybe history notes.”
Kris opened the library door without a word and held it open. The three of them stepped inside.

The library was warm. Still. The kind of stillness that made you whisper even when no one else was around. It smelled like old pages, static, and carpet cleaner.
Chara made a beeline toward the magazines, just to mess with the arrangement. Noelle hesitated, biting her lip.
“Uhm… weren’t we supposed to use the computer lab?”
Kris turned toward her.
“Yeah,” they said flatly. “We’ll study in there.”
Chara perked up. “Oooh, you mean that room? I heard they blocked all the fun sites. Laaame!”
“They didn’t block everything,” Kris said without looking at her.
That should’ve been her first clue.

The computer lab was dim. Light flickered from the monitors, casting soft, artificial glows on the walls. No one else was inside.
Chara stepped in first, whistling. “Kinda creepy in here, huh?”
Noelle hovered behind. “I-I think it’s fine… it’s just old.”
“Old and ominous,” Chara added, grinning. “My favorite combo.”
They stepped inside…
…It was pitch black.
The air tore.

There was no time to scream.
The floor dropped out from under Chara. Not like falling in a dream…no. This was real. Her stomach lurched, her heartbeat jackhammered, her hands flailed…
…and then…
Silence.

She landed hard on her side. Her cheek hit something that felt like static-charged glass. Sparks curled around her skin.
When she opened her eyes, the world was wrong.
Glowing neon roads spiraled across skyscrapers made of code. The sky was a dark void filled with floating symbols, smiley faces, loading bars, chat bubbles, all slowly spinning. The buildings shimmered, shifting pixel by pixel when she wasn’t looking directly at them.
She sat up slowly.
Her clothes had changed.
A cloak now rested on her shoulders...midnight blue, soft but heavy, with the Dreemurr family crest stitched in gold thread across the back. A heart-shaped clasp glinted at her collar.
Chara blinked hard.
“...Ellie?” she called out.
Noelle was a few feet away, looking terrified.
“Kris…?” Chara turned.
There they were.
Waiting.
Expressionless.
“...What did you do?” Chara whispered.
“This is the Dark World,” Kris said simply. “Another layer beneath reality.”
“That ain’t funny,” Chara snapped. “I didn’t sign up for this! We were supposed to study, remember?!”
“You’ll be fine,” Kris said, like they were reading from a script.
Chara felt her heart pound.
But she didn’t run.
She looked at Noelle,scared, shivering, but trusting Kris anyway...and made a decision.
She stayed.



Chapter 2: Freeze Command
Chara followed slowly.
Not because she wanted to,but because Kris was already walking, and Noelle had started moving too, and the last thing Chara wanted to be was alone in this neon-shadow world.
The Cyber World stretched ahead like a bad dream someone forgot to finish. Roads hovered in midair, guarded by cones with spinning eyes. Wires looped between buildings like spiderwebs. Everything hummed. Not music. Not electricity. Something… else.
A whispering tone, low and constant, just outside what her ears could catch. It buzzed under her skin.
She kept glancing around, half-expecting to see people. Other kids. Teachers. Anyone.
But it was just them.
Kris at the front, steady and eerily calm. Noelle at the center, hands clutched nervously to her chest. And Chara at the back, fingers itching with nerves, hoodie pulled tighter, trying to play it cool.
She didn’t say anything. But her heart was loud.

They turned a corner, and a shadow flickered ahead; a twisting, flickering, glitching like random advertisements. It smiled. A Poppup.
Chara jumped back with a yelp. “WHAT?!”
Kris didn’t flinch. Just stepped forward.
The enemy twisted closer. It began to charge.
Kris’s hand raised.
A red light appeared,hovering, pulsing in the center of space. Not theirs. Not Noelle’s. Not Chara’s.
Just Kris’s.
They stood like a conductor in an orchestra pit. Their voice, when it came, was cold. Commanding. Unblinking.
“Noelle,” they said. “Use IceShock.”
Noelle’s breath caught. “W-wait… Kris, I—I don’t—”
The light pulsed harder.
Kris didn’t raise their voice. They didn’t have to.
“Proceed.”
A second passed. Then another.
Noelle’s fingers moved slowly, like she didn’t trust them. She looked toward Chara...almost apologetic.
Then—
The air chilled for a moment.
Blue light.
A sound like icy tambourines.
Crackling.
The Pop-up’s movements froze mid-glitch.
It didn’t fall.
It didn’t fade.
It just… stayed.
Encased in Ice.
Shattered in place like a broken GIF.

Chara stepped back, eyes wide. “Ellie… what did you just do?!”
Noelle turned to her, eyes glassy. “I… I didn’t mean to. Kris told me to. I thought—”
Kris interrupted. “Forward.”
Chara looked between them. “Wha–wait, y’all just gonna leave that thing like that?”
Kris’s back was already turned. “It’s not a person.”
Chara opened her mouth to argue.
Then shut it.
Because… Ellie had listened. And Ellie was the kindest person she knew.
 So it had to be okay… right?
Right?

More shadows came.
And every time, Kris gave the same command.
“Noelle. IceShock.”
And every time, Noelle flinched, protested, shook her head...
And obeyed.
“Proceed.”
Over. And over.
Frozen monsters littered the side of the path, untouched. Not melting. Not disappearing. Just left behind like toys half-played with.
Chara couldn’t stop looking at them.
Eyes still open. Mouths half-smiling. Limbs mid-motion.
Like the moment the spell hit them, time just stopped. For them. Forever.
Chara shivered… she couldn't tell if it was because of the drop in temperature… or…  something else.

“I don’t think I like this,” Chara finally said, her voice smaller than she meant it to be.
Kris didn’t answer.
“Seriously. Shouldn’t we be sparin’ them? That’s how these things work in games, right?”
Still, no response.
She tried to laugh. It came out weak. “Kinda seems like y’all are goin’ a little too hard, don’tcha think?”
Kris paused.
Turned.
Their eyes...just barely visible under their hair...looked through her.
And they said...
“Noelle.”
Another shadow approached from the alley.
Kris didn’t even look at it.
“IceShock.”
Noelle hesitated, her voice trembling. “I… I don’t want to…”
Kris raised their hand again.
“Proceed.”
And she did.

Later, when the sky flickered to a darker shade of teal and the ambient static grew louder, Chara dropped back in the group, staring at the latest frozen statue.
Its face had changed mid-attack. You could still see the confusion.
“…I don’t like this,” she mumbled, wrapping her arms around herself. “I really, really don’t like this.”
Noelle didn’t answer. Her eyes were dull now. Like she was trying not to look at anything directly.

They stopped outside a towering building shaped like a CPU tower. The ground beneath it glitched every few seconds. The lights above buzzed loudly, flickering in and out of color.
Kris didn’t speak.
They just stared up.
Like they were waiting for something.
Chara kicked a pebble off the edge of the platform. Watched it fall into the digital void below.
“...Where even are we?” she whispered.
No one answered.
Kris’s voice broke the silence after a moment.
“We need to get stronger.”
Chara blinked. “Stronger for what? We’re not at war.”
She let out an annoyed huff. “B’sides, ain’t we already strong enough?”
Kris turned slightly.
“Soon,” they said. “It won’t be a choice.”

The words hung in the air like a loading screen that would never complete.
And beneath Chara’s cloak, the heart-shaped clasp felt heavier than before.


Chapter 3: Junk Data

The silence was different now.

It wasn’t just the hum of cyber-static or the distant screech of glitching skybirds—it was a silence that breathed. A presence that followed too closely. Like the entire Cyber World had turned to watch them walk. And it didn’t blink.

Chara hugged herself tighter as they entered the next section—a narrow alleyway lit by flickering signs, each one spewing corrupted text that scrolled too fast to read.

⚠️ 𝙵𝚁𝙴𝙴 𝙵𝙾𝙲𝚄𝚂 𝙳𝙾𝚆𝙽𝙻𝙾𝙰𝙳𝚂
✨ 𝚈𝙾𝚄 𝙰𝚁𝙴 𝙷𝙴𝚁𝙴. 𝚈𝙾𝚄 𝙰𝚁𝙴 𝙷𝙴𝚁𝙴. 𝚈𝙾𝚄 𝙰𝚁𝙴—

“...This place is wrong,” Chara whispered, voice trembling in spite of her usual bravado. “Everything here feels like it’s waitin’ for something.”

Noelle didn’t respond.

She walked beside her like a puppet with the strings cut too close. Her steps were careful, small, like she was afraid the floor would fall out again. The blue glow on her fingertips hadn’t fully faded. Chara kept catching it twitching, unconsciously.

“Ellie…” Chara began gently, reaching out. “Do you wanna take a break?”

Noelle flinched.

Her eyes met Chara’s—and for a second, there was something raw in them. Guilt. Fear. Something was screaming behind her smile.

But then she glanced at Kris ahead.

Kris hadn’t stopped walking.

And Noelle just… shook her head.
“N-no. It’s okay,” she said, in a voice that was practiced. “Kris says we’re close.”

Chara looked confused… but she didn’t mention it… Kris hadn’t even said anything.

Junk littered the streets ahead. Scraps of code and broken items: cracked glasses, USB cords coiled like worms, soda cans full of battery acid. One particularly strange piece—a small box—clicked as they passed. Chara turned toward it, curious.
It blinked.
Then whispered.
Not with a voice, but with code.

{[DO Y0U TRU$T TH3M?]}
She stared.
“What the hell…?” she murmured, stepping back.

“Something wrong?” Noelle asked quietly.
Chara forced a grin. “Nah. Just a talkin’ toaster. You know. Normal stuff.”
But her heart didn’t believe it.

And when she looked at Kris—silent, unmoved, leading them deeper into this maze—it felt like something inside her was slowly being pulled on. Stretched.
A string winding tighter.

Eventually, they came upon a wide platform. A Save Point blinked in the center, casting a calming light over the wires and neon cracks in the floor.
Chara stepped toward it, hesitating.
The moment they entered its warmth, she felt seen—like whatever watched them from this world couldn’t follow them here. Couldn’t touch her inside this circle.
Her fingers hovered near the beam…and dropped to her sides. She sighed.  It's not like she could do anything with it… after all, Kris controls the points.


But Kris didn’t stop.
They walked past it like it wasn’t even there.
Chara blinked. “Aren’t we gonna—?”

“Unnecessary,” Kris said flatly.

“...What if somethin’ happens?” she asked, voice quieter.
Kris turned just enough to meet her eyes.

“Then you’ll learn.”
It was subtle.
That was the worst part.

It wasn’t yelling. It wasn’t threats. It was confidence—the kind of certainty that makes you feel stupid for doubting. The kind of tone older siblings used when they were right.

Except… something in that tone made Chara’s fingers curl. Made her heart skip. Made her want to ask a thousand questions and not say a word all at once.
She looked at Noelle again.
Noelle was watching Kris, too.
Like she wanted to stop walking—but didn’t know how.

Ahead, another enemy appeared.
Not like the others.

This one was… slower.

A Wireframe figure with flickering arms and a blinking face. It wasn’t charging. It was pleading. Its movements were sluggish, as if it were already damaged.
Kris’s hand rose.
The red light returned.
“Noelle,” they said.
Noelle blinked. “...What?”

“IceShock.”

She hesitated. “Kris, that one—”
“Proceed.”
“B-but—!”
Chara stepped between them. “Wait a second! Ellie doesn’t want to!”
Kris’s voice didn’t change. “Then you do it.”
“Wh—?!”
Chara backed up like she'd been slapped.
Kris took a step closer.
“Attack it.”
Chara looked to Noelle in panic. “Ellie, I—I don’t—!”
Noelle stared, paralyzed.
Chara looked at Kris desperately, “K-Kris, I can't even USE magic!”
Kris’s eyes were blank.
Not angry. Not cruel.
Just certain.

“Proceed.”

Chara turned toward the enemy.
It raised a shaking arm.
Not to fight. Just to shield its face.

She couldn’t move.
Her hand ached, like something wanted to form in it—but didn’t. Like something was wanting to appear, but physically couldn't.
But on some level, she wanted to listen to her sibling…
“I—I can’t,” she whispered.

“Proceed.”

Chara swallowed.
Her knees locked. Her fingers trembled. Her mouth was dry.
She whispered back—

“I don’t wanna hurt anyone.”

And then—

Noelle moved.
She stepped forward, raised her arm, and cast IceShock.
The Wireframe enemy froze mid-motion. Its flickering face went still.

Chara didn’t scream.
But she wanted to.

After that, they walked in silence.
Even Chara didn’t try to joke.

She kept her eyes down, refusing to look at the statues they left behind. Her fingers itched again. Her chest felt like it was tightening.
Like something was coming.

And that’s when she heard it.
Off in the shadows. Past the next junction.
A voice, low and buzzing—

“[H3Y HEY, L1L’ G1RL!!]”

Something grinned behind a glitching alley wall.
“[L00KIN’ F0R A REAL POW3R UP??]”

And Chara paused.
Because something in her blood moved.
Like it had been waiting for that voice.

Chapter 4: The Salesman
The alleys narrowed.
The deeper they went, the more the world stopped pretending to make sense.
Signs flickered in tongues Chara didn’t recognize—binary bleeding into cursive, emojis dripping into kanji. The street lamps were crooked. Some buzzed; others blinked on and off like a bad heartbeat. The buildings leaned in, watching. Judging.
And through it all, Kris walked like none of it mattered.
Like this was all normal.
Chara couldn’t tell if she was sweating, freezing, or both.
Her hand gripped the edge of her cloak, trying to keep her heart from pounding its way out of her chest. Her voice was hoarse. When had she last spoken? She didn’t even remember.
But she couldn’t take it anymore.
“E… Ellie,” she whispered.
Noelle didn’t answer.
Chara looked up.
She was just staring forward. Blank. Empty. Her hands were twitching every few seconds. Blue frost still lingered around her fingertips from the last spell she’d cast. Not melting.
“Ellie, please. Look at me—” Chara reached for her sleeve.
Noelle flinched at her touch.
Pulled away.
Didn’t say anything.
Didn’t even apologize.
Didn’t even turn her head. 
Just kept walking.

Chara stopped walking.
Just… stopped.
She stared at the back of their heads—Noelle’s soft curls bouncing with each step, Kris’s silhouette sharp against the neon horizon—and felt her lungs tighten.
Her voice cracked.
“Kris…”
They paused.
Turned halfway.
Their face didn’t change.
That same stoic, expressionless look they always had.
Waiting.
Like they knew she wasn’t going anywhere.
“Where are we going?” she asked, breath hitching. “Wh-why won’t Ellie talk to me? Why won’t she—why are you making her freeze people?!”
Kris blinked once.
“Because we need to get stronger,” they said.
Their voice was a stone.
Solid. Cold.
Not their own.
Their voice sounded as if it were coming from a low-quality speaker, rather than their own vocal cords.
“You’ll understand soon.”
…but that look in their eyes, it looked like they had wanted to say something completely different than what just came out of their mouth.
And then—
They turned a corner.
And disappeared from view.

Chara’s legs moved before her brain did.
“Wait! Don’t—don’t leave me here!”
She chased after them, boots skidding on the tile-like flooring, cloak flaring behind her. Her eyes burned. Whether from fear or tears, she didn’t know anymore.

And then—
She saw it.
A crooked alley.
Black. Bent. Static bleeding out of the cracks.
And at the end of it…
Him.
A short, thing that resembled a man in a suit, with the confidence of a door-to-door salesman, he wore unsettling-looking sunglasses, one of the lenses was pink, while the other was yellow.
Spamton.
Grinning much too wide.
Hands twitching with artificial excitement.
“WELL, WELL, W3LL!! LOOK WHO'S BEEN [[FOLLOWING THE PATH]] LAID OUT BY [[F4MILIAL LOVE]] AND [[TRUSTED COMPANIONS]]!!”
Chara froze.
Something in her soul lurched.
She didn’t know why—but she didn’t want to be near him.
Didn’t want him to see her.
Didn't want to know what he was selling.
But Kris?
Kris walked up to him like they were meeting a friend.
Like this was part of the plan.
Spamton twitched and cackled and flailed as they approached.
“Y0U!! K-KRISSS!!, YOU [[Little Sponge]]!!,IF IT ISN’T MY FAVORITE     [[NUMBER 1 CUSTOMER!!]], BACK AGAIN FOR ANOTHER [[UNBEATABLE DEAL]]?? OR MAYBE—” his head twisted. He looked past Kris. Directly at Chara.
 Her blood went cold.
“—A G1FT FOR YOUR [L1L’ S1BBIN]!!”
Chara took a step back. Her cloak snagged on a wire. She didn’t even notice.
Spamton twitched violently.
“I CAN SEE THE [[i don’t know about this…]] IN HER EYES!!!
 THE [[Call for help…]] 
THE [[OST 28 - Premonition]]!!”
He leaned closer toward Kris.
Voice low.
Mocking.
“SHE AIN’T R3ADY FOR WHAT’S C0MING, KRIS. BUT MAYBE YOU KNEW THAT. MAYBE YOU NEED HER TO BE… [[STRONGER]], W3LL, KRIS, DON’T YOU [[Worry your pretty little head]], 
I HAVE… 
JUST… 
THE THING… 
YOU NEED. 
IN 0RD3R TO GET HER TO [[Accept The Terms And Conditions.]]”
Kris didn’t answer.
But they reached into their pocket.
Pulled out dark bills of paper-like material.
It’s supposedly the currency of the dark world.
Currency not found in the real world.
Chara’s voice cracked. “Kris, what are you doing?”
Spamton lit up; he let out a cackle that sounded like a cross between a computer crashing and a sitcom's laugh track.
“[AH—AH—AHA!!] I SEE!! A [[TRANSACTION]] OF THE HIGHEST 0RD3R!!”
He slid open his coat, revealing rows and rows of jagged items. Most of them buzzed with low static—broken code and twisted knives, half-formed contracts and glowing red tape.
But Kris pointed at one.
A black velvet case.
Locked.
Unopened.
Spamton cackled. “OHHHH YES!!! A CLASSIC!!! A [[LIMITED TIME RELEASE]]!!! ONCE OPENED, [[THERE’S NO GOING BACK]]!!”
“JUST A LITTLE [[SOMETH1N]] TO HELP YOUR LIL’ SIS [[STAY SHARP]]. HEH HEH HEHHH!!”
Kris didn’t take it.
Not yet.
But they nodded.

Chara stepped back, panic bubbling up. Her breath hitched.
“Wh—what is that?! What are you buying?! I don’t want it! I don’t want anything from him!”
Kris looked at her.
Completely neutral.
Then turned back to Spamton.
“...She will.”
Spamton's teeth clicked in glee.

Chara’s fingers trembled.
Noelle hadn’t moved.
She stood just behind her, eyes blank, breath shallow.
Her friend.
Her best friend.
The one she trusted.
And she wasn’t even there anymore.
Chara took a step toward her, voice cracking like a frayed wire.
“Ellie, please—say something. Please. Tell me I’m not crazy. Tell me I’m not just—just overreacting!”
Noelle blinked slowly.
She looked down at her hands.
They were still cold.
She whispered, almost mechanically:
“I didn’t want to. But they said to proceed.”

Chara broke.
She turned around and ran.
Not far. There was nowhere to go.
But she had to get away.
Away from the salesman.
Away from Kris.
Away from the sound of that word.
Away from that voice that was speaking through Kris.
She collapsed near the edge of the alley, knees scraping the floor, heart hammering. Her breath came in ragged bursts.
Tears welled up and finally fell.
Not because she was sad.
Because she was scared.
This wasn’t what she signed up for. This wasn’t studying. This wasn’t fun. This wasn’t—
“You’ll understand soon.”

Behind her, she heard Kris say something else to Spamton.
She couldn’t hear the words.
But she heard Spamton laughing.




Chapter 5: Focus
Chara sat on the cold tile, clutching her locket like it could save her.
She didn’t remember taking it out—her fingers had found it on their own, fumbling for anything familiar. She ran her thumb over the gold heart, trying to breathe… Trying to calm down.
It didn’t help.
Not when the alley behind her was still laughing.
Not when the man with the teeth was still talking.
Not when her big sibling was still making deals.
She wiped her eyes on her sleeve.
She wanted to go home.
She should’ve stayed home.
But she had decided to be a brat and demanded to come to the library with Kris and Noelle…
Is this her punishment?

She flinched when Kris's shadow fell over her shoulder.
She hadn’t even heard them walk up. It was like they’d just… appeared.
“Come back,” they said.
Chara tensed.
Didn’t move.
Kris waited.
Didn’t ask again.
Just stood.
Their tone wasn't threatening. Wasn't emotional.
 It didn’t need to be.
They were her older sibling.
And she was still their little sister.
"...I don’t want to," she whispered.
No response.
“I don’t… I don’t like this place,” her voice trembled. “Ellie’s scared. I’m scared. That guy’s not right. That thing you’re buying—”
Kris's head tilted just slightly.
Their eyes met hers.
“Come back.”
That was it.
That’s all they said.
Not a command.
 Not a request.
Just inevitability.

Chara stood.
She didn’t want to.
Her knees felt like rusted joints. Her legs didn’t belong to her anymore. But her body moved anyway—slow, reluctant, like a puppet being pulled from a string tied around her locket.
She followed them.
Back to the alley.
Back to the salesman.

Spamton cackled with delight the moment she stepped into the static glow of his neon stall.
“W3LL WELL W3LL!! TH3RE SHE I$!! THE [[STAR OF THE SHOW]]!!”
Chara stepped back instinctively. Her hands balled into fists.
Kris didn’t look at her.
They were already reaching into their pocket.
Dark bills stacked high between their fingers. Darkworld currency– not fairly earned, but something deeper. Stolen… from the countless people they had made Noelle freeze on the way here.
Spamton vibrated in excitement, steam hissing from his ears.
“[PAYMENT ACCEPTED!!!] THANK YOU FOR YOUR [UNHOLY PATRONAGE]!!!”
He handed over the case.
Black. Velvet. Sealed with a ribbon that seemed to move on its own.
Kris took it without hesitation.
Turned toward Chara.
And held it out.
She stared at it.
Didn’t take it.
Didn’t move.
The static deepened. The alley buzzed louder.
Noelle’s footsteps approached slowly from behind.

Kris finally looked at Chara.
Expression blank.
“You’ll need this.”
Her throat dried. “What is it?”
Kris didn’t answer.
Just pressed the case into her hands.
She didn’t remember reaching for it.
But it was there.
The ribbon fell off without her touching it.
The box opened.
And there it was.
Fracture Fang.
Jagged. Black. Humming in the air like a cold breath against her spine. A blade that looked wrong in every direction—curved like a question mark no one should ask, wrapped in a red grip that seemed to pulse.
She didn’t want to touch it.
She couldn’t stop touching it.
The second her fingers closed around the hilt—
The world shifted.

Not physically.
Not visually.
Just… internally.
Her thoughts dulled. Her breath stilled. Her heartbeat slowed like it had been ordered to. Her body numbed slightly, like the air had gotten thicker.
She didn’t feel fear anymore.
She didn’t feel anything.
A fog settled over her senses.
A single thought echoing quietly:
Focus.

Kris looked behind Chara… at Noelle. Still and quiet, like before, they walked up to her without a word.
They simply reached into their pocket again, pulled out something faintly glowing—a ring Chara had never seen before—and held it out to her..
She grabbed it.
The moment it slipped back onto her finger—
Her eyes lit up again. Her hands stopped shaking.
Her soul—whatever part of it had been missing—came back.
Noelle let out a tiny gasp.
Her hand reached to her chest—grabbing at something that was no longer there.
“Wh… What happened…?”
Her voice cracked like an old record.
Kris didn’t answer.
She took a breath like it was her first in hours.
“Kris…” she whispered. Her voice was hers again. Soft. Human… Well, as human as a deer monster can sound.  “I—I’m sorry. I don’t… I don’t know what I was doing. I kept—I couldn’t stop—”
Kris placed a hand on her shoulder.
“Don’t worry.”
They looked at Chara.
“We’ve got her now.”

Chara didn’t respond.
Her hand still clutched the dagger.
It was light.
Too light.
It felt like it wasn’t there—just a thought she couldn’t shake.
A thought she hadn’t chosen.
Her fingers wouldn’t let go.
She stared down at it.
It shimmered faintly, like it was waiting.
For what?
A command?
A victim?

Noelle’s eyes widened when she saw it.
“Chara…?”
The girl looked up slowly.
Expression blank.
Not numb.
Not calm.
Just…
Empty.
Like someone had taken the Chara who’d been scared and crying just minutes ago and buried her under a still pond.
She opened her mouth.
Didn’t speak.
Didn’t need to.
Kris stepped forward.
“We’ll move faster now,” they said.
Noelle hesitated. “…You’re not going to make me do it again?”
Kris glanced back over their shoulder.
“No.”
They looked at Chara.
“She will.”


Chapter 6: First Cut

Chara hadn’t spoken since she picked up the dagger.

She couldn’t.

The trance saw to that.

Every breath she took felt shallow, like she was trying to inhale through gauze. Her fingers refused to let go. No matter how hard she willed them to… no matter how much her body begged… the blade remained clenched tight in her grip.

And it hurt.

It had started as a sharp sting, just under the palm. Like when you grip something too tightly and feel a seam split. But now. . .

Now it was worse.

The hilt was biting into her. Digging deeper with every step. Cold. Almost wet. She didn’t want to look down, but her eyes drifted anyway.

Blood. Just a line.

A red thread dripping from the side of her palm, trailing down her wrist like it didn’t belong to her, almost as if she was a puppet and that was the thread connecting her to… whatever was controlling her.

And still… No scream. No wince. No flinch.

The trance had muted all of it.

All that was left was—

> Focus.




---



They walked.

The alleys gave way to broader cyberstreets, gleaming with chrome towers and spiraling data-vines, but Chara saw none of it.

She saw the dagger.

She heard it hum.

She felt the pulse of something dark inside it, like it was remembering violence she hadn’t committed yet.

> Shattershock: 16 TP
Status: Available



She didn’t even know what that meant.

But she could feel it—waiting. Like it was behind a door in her head that she wasn’t ready to open. Not yet.

The cold pain in her fingers deepened.


---

Kris stopped suddenly.

Enemy ahead.

Some half-corrupted PopUp. Slow. Glitching. Barely holding its shape.

It beeped weakly. One of its dialogue boxes stuttered open.

> [i—please—don’t—ads—]



Chara stood motionless.

Blood dripping from her hand.

Eyes flat.

Expression distant.
All the lively energy and fun playfulness she had earlier had vanished, hidden so deep in her thoughts that it seemed like a dream she couldn't fully recall.
Kris didn’t even glance at Noelle.

Just turned to Chara.

“Shattershock.”

She blinked slowly. “I don’t—”

“Proceed.”

The trance tightened.

Her legs moved on their own.

The dagger raised itself.

And the moment the tip aligned with the PopUp’s chest—

Lightning bloomed.

A jagged line of unnatural, silent frost rippled through the air—like broken glass in a storm—and the PopUp froze. Not shattered. Not defeated. Just locked in place.

Still alive.

Still blinking.

Unable to move.

The status effect glitched above its head:

> ❄ PARALYZED



The spell hadn’t killed it.

But it had erased its options.

It could no longer run.

No longer flee.

No longer beg.

Only wait.

Chara stood still, blood soaking the hilt.

And she whispered without meaning to:

“…Sorry.”


---

Noelle’s breath caught behind her.

She stepped forward—past Kris, for once—and reached for Chara’s shoulder.

“Chara, hey. Hey—are you okay?”

No answer.

“Your hand. You’re bleeding. Char, give me the– give me the knife, okay? You don’t have to—”

“Unnecessary,” Kris said.

Noelle turned sharply. “Like HELL it’s unnecessary.”

Kris tilted their head. Calm. Cold. Blank.

“Chara can handle it.”

“She’s fifteen, Kris,” Noelle said, stepping between them now. “She came here because she wanted to hang out. Not to—whatever this is!”

Kris didn’t speak.

Their expression didn’t change.

They just watched her.

So Noelle kept going.

“She looks up to you, you know that? I’ve known her since she was little. She trusts you because you’re her family. You were supposed to protect her, not—not hand her off to some monster with a glitchy trench coat!”

Her voice cracked.

“She’s scared.”

Still, Kris said nothing.

So she took a shaky breath and snapped, “Why are you even doing this?”

Kris looked down at Chara.

Then at the dagger.

Then at Noelle.

And finally answered.

“Because she’s perfect for it.”

Noelle froze…. She half expected the usual answer of “To Get Stronger.”

“What…?”

“She listens,” Kris said. “Even when she’s scared. Even when it hurts.”

A pause.

Then:

“You didn’t.”


---

Noelle reeled like she’d been slapped.

And for once, Kris didn’t keep walking.

They let her have that moment.

Let her feel it.

Didn’t interrupt. Didn’t argue.

Just waited.

Waited for her to realize they weren’t going to change.

That she wasn’t the piece on the board anymore.

Because now they had Chara.


---

They walked again.

Noelle followed behind slowly, still shell-shocked, still breathing too fast.

She kept her distance from Kris now.

But her eyes… her eyes never left Chara.

Not once.

Not even when the streets darkened again and another enemy blinked into view.

This one ran.

A little puzzlebot that chirped in panicked text before skittering away.

Kris made no move to chase.

They didn’t need to.

They looked at Chara.

“Again.”


---

Chara raised the dagger.

It felt heavier this time.

She didn’t want to lift it.

She didn’t want to do this.

But her arms moved anyway.

Her throat stayed silent.

Blood smeared down her wrist.

She whispered, "Please... stop..."

The dagger hummed.

> Shattershock: Ready.

Chapter 7: Missing Pieces

Chara wanted to scream.

The dagger hadn’t left her hand.
It wouldn’t.

Her palm was slick now—warm, sticky. The more she tried to shift her grip, the deeper the edge bit into her skin. Every pulse of her heart squeezed another drop through her fingers, another line crawling down her wrist.

It hurt. Terribly. Before today, she would have never had been able to imagine this much pain.
But now? …Now it felt like torture.

But she couldn’t cry.
She couldn’t beg.
The trance drowned every sound before it could leave her lips.

And so she walked.
She walked because Kris said so.
Because Kris had said–

> “Proceed.”
---

Noelle followed behind, hugging her arms to her chest. Her steps were quicker than she wanted them to be, tripping over themselves.

Her eyes darted back and forth, between Chara’s trembling shoulders, the dagger carving shallow light through the dark, and Kris.

Always back to Kris.

Every few seconds, she thought she saw it… Hesitation. A twitch in their brow, the slightest curl of their lip, a tremor that didn’t belong to a commander.

But the moment they opened their mouth, that fragile hope curdled.

Because their voice wasn’t theirs.

It rasped, distorted, as if it was squeezing through a rusted speaker. No warmth. No crack. Just tin and static.

“Again.”

Noelle froze.

The word wasn’t even shaped by Kris’s throat.
It was pressed into the air.


---

Another enemy had appeared.

A small, digital catlike thing, lines flickering through its ears. It wasn’t even aggressive. It pawed at the ground, mewling little sparks of code, then tried to turn away.

Chara’s body locked onto it.

Her bloodied hand raised the dagger.

Her chest ached. “Stop, stop, stop, I don’t want to—”

The hum sharpened.

> Shattershock: Ready.



The air split.
A ripple of frozen glass shot across the street.
The cat froze mid-step, a glitching statue of fur and ice.

Alive.
Silent.
Helpless.


---

Noelle gasped. “Chara—Chara, h-hey, look at me. You’re hurt, you’re bleeding. Please, just—just let me— I-I know healing magic! I-I can-”

Kris’s head turned toward her.
Slowly.

And Noelle’s throat closed.

She had meant to keep going, meant to grab Chara and run, meant to pull her behind and run. But when Kris looked at her—not Kris, something through Kris—her body refused.

Her hands shook uselessly at her sides.

“Unnecessary,” the static voice rasped.

Noelle flinched. “She’s your sister! Don’t you—don’t you even care what this is doing to her?!”

Kris’s lips twitched—just slightly.
For a moment, their eyes looked almost human.

But then the flat speaker-tone pressed out again:

“She listens. Even when it hurts.”

Noelle’s stomach sank.

And yet—she swore she saw it—something behind Kris’s eyes. Regret. Desperation. Small. Flickering. Trying to get out.

But the words that followed crushed it flat.

“Proceed.”


---

Chara’s body obeyed.

Her dagger-hand twitched. Another thread of red rolled down her arm.

Her knees buckled slightly, but her feet corrected before she could fall.

She couldn’t run.
She couldn’t cry.
The trance locked her bones like a vice.

Inside her mind, though—
Inside—

“I want it to stop… please… please just let it stop… Someone… please help me…”

* But Nobody Came…

The cold only answered.


---

Noelle pressed her hand against her mouth, biting down on her palm to keep from sobbing. She wanted to grab Chara and run, but she could feel Kris’s stare—like the moment she moved, something worse would happen.

She whispered to herself instead.

“It’s not you. I know it’s not you. Please, Kris, just—say something. Say anything.”

But Kris didn’t answer.

Couldn’t answer.

Their lips parted.
The voicebox rasp filled the air again.
“Proceed.”
Chapter 8: Glass Garden

The dagger pulsed in Chara’s hand like a second heartbeat.
Her own pulse fought against it—blood seeping between her fingers, dripping steady, sticky trails onto the neon-lit street.

She wanted to drop it.
She wanted to let it clatter to the ground, clutch her aching hand to her chest, and run crying into Ellie’s arms.

But she couldn’t.

Every time her muscles twitched toward letting go, the blade sang, a low vibrating hum that locked her grip tighter. Her knuckles were bone-white, her palm torn. The pain drilled deeper, past flesh, into thought.

And she couldn’t cry.
She couldn’t scream.
The trance swallowed every sound, every plea, before they left her throat.

Her mind was full of noise.
Too full.

“Why, Kris? Why are you making me do this?
I don’t—I don’t want to—
It hurts, it hurts so much, Azzy please, I wish you were here, I wish you could—
Big brothers fix things, right? They tell you it’s okay? They don’t—”

Her chest heaved, but no sob came out.
Only the hum of the blade.


---

Kris stood ahead, their stance rigid. Their hands twitched at their sides like they weren’t sure whether to clench into fists or reach out. Their jaw locked tight.

Noelle watched their face in horror.

For a flicker of a second—just one—their expression cracked. Their mouth opened, pulling in a sharp breath like they were about to say her name.

But the sound that came out was wrong.

A monotone rasp, static through a broken speaker:
“Proceed.”

Kris’s eyes widened the instant the word left their lips—like even they hadn’t chosen it. Their throat bobbed. Their fists clenched until their nails dug crescent moons into their palms.

Noelle swore she saw them shake their head, just slightly. Just enough to look like resistance.

But then their body straightened again, and the voice returned.

“Again.”


---

Noelle’s stomach churned.

Her mind scrambled in circles, faster than she could breathe.

"I should stop this. I should take the dagger from Chara. I should grab her and run. But Kris—they’d—what if they—”

Her throat tightened.
“What if they hurt her worse? What if they hurt me?”

Her arms wrapped around herself, nails digging into her sleeves.

“I could leave. I could go get help. But… What if I leave her here? She’s fifteen. She’s—she’s just a kid. She’s Kris’s little sister. And she looks at me like—like I’m supposed to protect her—”

Her eyes stung.
“B u t   I   c a n ’ t   e v e n   m o v e.”

She looked at Chara’s face. The girl’s eyes were wide and glassy, her lips trembling, but no sound came out.

Her free hand twitched toward her, then stopped.
Do something. Do something. Do something—


---

Kris’s own head was a warzone.

“Not her. Please. Not my sister. She’s just a kid. Don’t—don’t make me—”

The SOUL burned in their chest, pulsing like a hand crushing their ribs. Every step, every command, it shoved through them, puppeteering their body like it was nothing more than a stiff marionette.

Their mouth opened, and they tried—they tried—to say something. To choke out, stop, please stop.

But the word that came out was the same metallic rasp:

“Proceed.”

Kris’s eyes watered, just for a heartbeat, before they snapped flat again. Their body moved without their permission, gesturing forward.

And Chara obeyed.


---

Chara’s hand lifted.
Her arm shook violently, blood dripping down her wrist. The blade pulsed against her skin, humming.

The next command waited in the air, vibrating through her chest like invisible strings.

She wanted to throw up.
She wanted to collapse.

She wanted Kris to stop.

But her body didn’t care what she wanted.

The trance didn’t care.

She marched forward.

---
Noelle clutched her mouth, whispering into her palm, voice cracking.

“Chara… I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to do.”
